Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. Today, we are going to deconstruct a fascinating strategic presentation titled **"Winning Strategies for AI in 2026"** (*2026年 AIの勝ち筋*).

This presentation was delivered by **Miku Hirano**, the CEO of Cinnamon AI. It offers a high-level roadmap for how Artificial Intelligence is evolving from simple chatbots into a fully integrated business infrastructure.

I have structured this lecture into four key parts based on the slide deck provided:
1.  **The Speaker & The Vision**
2.  **The Tech Evolution: From 2025 to 2026**
3.  **The Multi-Agent Philosophy**
4.  **The Core Framework: The 4 Quadrants of AI Utility**

### Part 1: The Speaker & The Vision

First, let’s establish who is speaking. Miku Hirano is a serial entrepreneur with a Master’s degree from the University of Tokyo, specializing in recommendation engines and complex networks. She is a heavy hitter in the Japanese tech scene, serving on government councils regarding IT strategy and tax commissions, and was selected as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.

Her company, **Cinnamon AI**, focuses on a specific mission: **"To create a knowledge platform for organizations that supports human will and decision-making."**

Their flagship product is **"Super RAG"** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
*   **Why does this matter?** Standard AI models "hallucinate" (make things up). Cinnamon AI claims their RAG platform is 3x more accurate than competitors because it specializes in reading unstructured documents—like complex tables and graphs—and citing its sources. This reliability is the foundation for what comes next.

### Part 2: The Tech Evolution (2025 vs. 2026)

Now, let’s look at the critical timeline presented in the "Technology Evolution" slide. Ms. Hirano draws a sharp distinction between where we were in 2025 and where we are going in 2026.

1.  **LLM (Large Language Models):**
    *   **2025:** The AI became smarter than most humans and became multimodal (handling text, images, audio).
    *   **2026 Prediction:** AI stops being a separate tool and gets **directly embedded into business processes.** You won't "use" AI; it will just be the engine running the process.

2.  **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):**
    *   **2025:** It was used mainly to stop AI from lying (anti-hallucination) and for internal Q&A bots.
    *   **2026 Prediction:** RAG becomes **"Self-Growing."** It integrates with agent flows, meaning the AI learns and updates its own knowledge base automatically.

3.  **Agents:**
    *   **2025:** We saw basic workflows with limited autonomy.
    *   **2026 Prediction:** We move to **Task-Specific Specialization.** Agents become the core of an "AI First" business model.

**The takeaway:** We are moving from "AI as a Chatbot" to "AI as an Employee."

### Part 3: The Multi-Agent Philosophy

This leads us to the concept of **Multi-Agents**. Why do we need more than one AI?

As the presentation explains, **"The essence of Multi-Agent is the design philosophy of dividing roles and creating interaction."**

Just like a human organization, a single "genius" AI cannot do everything. You need:
*   **Decomposition:** Breaking complex jobs into smaller tasks.
*   **Self-Correction:** One agent acts as the "Doer," another as the "Checker."
*   **Role Design:** Controlling quality by assigning specific personas to specific steps.

This structure allows companies to eventually build an **"AI Organization."**

### Part 4: The Core Framework (The 4 Quadrants)

This is the most critical part of the lecture. Please visualize the matrix shown in the slides (Slides 6, 7, and 8). This is the **"Winning Strategy."**

The matrix is divided by two axes:
*   **Vertical (Y-Axis):** Input (Natural Language vs. Non-Natural Language/System Data).
*   **Horizontal (X-Axis):** Output (Natural Language vs. Non-Natural Language/System Action).

This creates four distinct quadrants:

1.  **Top-Right (The Chatbot):**
    *   *Input: Talk -> Output: Talk.*
    *   **Example:** A standard Chatbot.
    *   **Strategy Phase:** **"Adoption" (Step 1).** This is the entry point. It's easy for humans to understand, but it doesn't do much real work.

2.  **Top-Left (Execution Entry):**
    *   *Input: Talk -> Output: Action.*
    *   **Example:** You say "Book a ticket," and the system executes the reservation.
    *   **Strategy Phase:** **"Value Creation" (Step 2).** Here, the AI takes **Execution Rights.** It stops just talking and starts doing.

3.  **Bottom-Right (Contact/Notification):**
    *   *Input: System Data -> Output: Talk.*
    *   **Example:** A confirmation email sent after a booking.
    *   **Strategy Phase:** **"Trust" (Step 3).** By explaining what happened in natural language, the AI ensures transparency.

4.  **Bottom-Left (True Business AI):**
    *   *Input: System Data -> Output: Action.*
    *   **Example:** An invoice arrives (data), and the payment is processed (action) without human speech involved.
    *   **Strategy Phase:** **"Dominance" (Step 4).** This is the holy grail. It maximizes economic rationality. It is pure automation.

#### The "Winning Strategy" Flow

Ms. Hirano’s argument for the "Winning Strategy" (Slide 8) is a specific counter-clockwise movement through these quadrants:

1.  **Enter via the Top-Right (UI):** Hook users with a friendly chat interface.
2.  **Shift Left (Execution):** Convince users to give the AI the power to *do* things (delegate authority).
3.  **Drop Down (Automation):** Once the AI has the authority and the data, move the process to the Bottom-Left.

**The ultimate goal is to "Enclose via Automation" (Bottom-Left).**
Companies that stay in the Top-Right (just Chatbots) will lose. The winners in 2026 will be those who use the chat interface only as a gateway to capture the data and permission needed to run fully automated, backend "True Business AI" processes.

### Summary

To summarize this lecture:
**2026 is the year AI goes "headless."**

We are transitioning from asking ChatGPT a question and getting a text answer, to a world where AI agents communicate with each other to pay bills, manage logistics, and execute workflows. The "Winning Strategy" is to use conversational AI to gain user trust, only to eventually hand off the heavy lifting to silent, automated agents running in the background.

Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.

In Part 1, we discussed the *machinery* of the future: Multi-Agents, the shift from chatbots to full automation, and the "winning strategy" of embedding AI into the very core of business operations.

But this raises a terrifying question for many: **If AI is doing the execution, what is left for the humans?**

In Part 2 of this lecture, we are going to explore Miku Hirano’s answer to that question. We will cover the new definition of human value, the battle between "Creativity" and "Accuracy," and the geopolitical landscape of 2026.

Let's dive into the **Human-AI Symbiosis**.

---

### Part 1: The New Hierarchy of Work

Please look at the **Pyramid of Symbiosis** (Slide 10). This is the blueprint for organizational design in the AI era. Hirano separates work into three distinct layers:

1.  **The Execution Layer (Bottom):** This is "Operations and Repetition." This layer is now the domain of **AI**.
2.  **The Judgment Layer (Middle):** This is "Design and Trade-offs." This is a hybrid zone of **Humans + AI**.
3.  **The Will Layer (Top):** This is "Purpose, Value, and Meaning." This remains uniquely **Human**.

But how do you decide what the AI handles? Hirano provides a brilliant framework called the **"Three Types of Judgment Design"** (Slide 11). If you are a manager, memorize this:

*   **Type A: Rules.** If a task can be codified into clear logic (if X, then Y), **give it to the AI.** Your job is simply to write the rule clearly.
*   **Type B: Trade-offs.** These are situations where values conflict—like balancing speed vs. cost, or quality vs. quantity. There is no single "right" answer. Here, the **AI proposes options**, but the **Human makes the final call.**
*   **Type C: Exceptions.** These are unprecedented events or decisions with massive social impact. The AI steps back. The **Human takes full responsibility.**

This leads to a profound conclusion (Slide 12): In the AI era, your competitive advantage is no longer your knowledge or your speed. **Your asset is your "Will" (Ishi).** It is your ability to define value and accept the risk of responsibility.

### Part 2: The "G" vs. "R" Matrix

Next, let’s look at the technological landscape. Hirano introduces the **G vs. R Matrix** (Slide 13 & 14).

*   **G = Generate:** Creativity, natural text, storytelling, idea generation.
*   **R = Retrieval:** Accuracy, citing sources, handling internal company data, not lying.

**The History:**
In **2025**, the world was obsessed with "High G." We saw tools for video creation and creative writing explode. It was the year of "AI as a Creator."

**The 2026 Shift:**
However, for *business* survival, "High G" isn't enough. You can't have an AI accounting agent that is "creative" with your taxes. You need accuracy.

Hirano’s strategy (Slide 15 & 16) depicts a specific movement: **The winning product must first master "High R" (Accuracy) and then combine it with "High G."**

This is why Cinnamon AI is betting on "Super RAG." They are targeting sectors where mistakes are fatal:
*   Legal & Contracts
*   Manufacturing Quality Assurance
*   Medical & Pharmaceutical Regulations
*   Finance & Risk Assessment

If you are building an AI product in 2026, ask yourself: **Are you building a toy (High G) or a tool (High R)?**

### Part 3: The Geopolitical Arena

The presentation then zooms out to the **National Strategy** level (Slides 18-20). By late 2025, the major powers had all solidified their AI stances. Hirano offers a stark comparison of national motivations:

*   🇺🇸 **The USA:** Wants **Hegemony.** Their strategy is dominance, speed, and deregulation to maintain innovation leadership.
*   🇨🇳 **China:** Wants **Global Standards.** They focus on social control and industrial application to make their tech the world's infrastructure.
*   🇪🇺 **The EU:** Wants **Sovereignty.** Their goal is not to be dominated. They focus on rules (the AI Act) and risk management.
*   🇯🇵 **Japan:** Wants **Sustainability.** Japan’s strategy is unique. It is a "National Power Maintenance Device." Japan views AI as the *only* solution to its shrinking population and labor shortage.

**Japan's Specific "Win Conditions":**
Because Japan cannot compete on raw data scale like the US or China, Hirano identifies two niche battlegrounds where Japan can win:
1.  **AI for Science (Slide 20):** Automating laboratory experiments in materials science, where Japan is already a leader.
2.  **Physical AI (Slide 21):** AI with a body. Not cool sci-fi robots, but practical automation in "semi-structured environments" like warehouses, factories, and infrastructure maintenance.

### Conclusion: "Clear Your Will"

We conclude with a message to leadership (Slide 22).

The speed of evolution in 2026 is terrifying. Technologies that were groundbreaking six months ago are obsolete today. Hirano’s advice is twofold:
1.  **Don't cling to the past.** Enjoy the speed.
2.  **Clarify your Will.**

Because the AI can do the work, and the AI can even help judge the trade-offs, but the AI cannot give your organization its **meaning**.

Ms. Hirano closes by announcing her upcoming book, *"Kokoro wo Sumaseba"* (Clearing the Mind), releasing in March 2026. It serves as a reminder that in a world of artificial intelligence, the ultimate competitive advantage is a clear, human mind.

Thank you very much.
