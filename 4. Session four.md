## 1. Course context

This session is part of **AI Business Insights 2026** (PwC). The theme is:

* **AI-driven transformation of procurement and purchasing** (often discussed as part of broader **Supply Chain Management (SCM)** transformation).

In the clip, there are also brief course logistics slides (attendance rules, how to ask questions via Slido, etc.). The core lecture begins with the “why now” for SCM reform, then moves to **AI/GenAI’s role**, concrete **procurement use cases**, and an invited segment about **supply-chain risk and resilience platforms**.

---

## 2. Why supply chains and procurement must change now

The lecture frames SCM/procurement as being disrupted because the “assumptions that supported the old common sense” are changing. The drivers include:

### (A) ESG and sustainability are no longer optional

Supply chains are increasingly judged on:

* emissions and energy impact
* human rights and labor practices
* traceability and accountability

This shifts procurement from “buy cheapest safely” to **buy responsibly + transparently + resiliently**.

### (B) Product and cost structures are shifting (e.g., electrification + software)

Many industries see:

* higher complexity (hardware + software, electronics, semiconductors)
* different cost breakdowns (components, IP, specialized suppliers)
* different demand signals and shorter cycles

### (C) Volatility and disruption have become the baseline

Procurement now must plan for:

* raw-material price swings
* supply shortages (capacity, logistics constraints)
* disasters and climate-related disruption
* geopolitical shocks (sanctions, tariffs, trade restrictions)

### (D) “Good products sell even if expensive”

This implies the target is not only cost-down. Procurement must support:

* speed to market
* resilience to disruption
* strategic supply advantages
* product differentiation

**Bottom line:** procurement is moving from “back-office purchasing” to a **strategic function** that directly shapes competitiveness.

---

## 3. What “good SCM reform” aims for

The session summarizes reform outcomes as a foundation for improving “competitiveness,” expressed through three capabilities:

* **Agility**: respond faster (shorten detection → decision → action loops)
* **Adaptability**: adjust well to structural change (new suppliers, new constraints)
* **Alignment**: coordinate trade-offs across functions and partners (cost, service, risk, ESG)

Think of these as the “north star” metrics. AI initiatives should be evaluated by whether they improve one or more of these (not merely “we installed a tool”).

---

## 4. Major reform trends

The slides categorize reforms into broader trends that are **not isolated** to one department:

### Trend 1 — **End-to-End (E2E) visibility**

You cannot manage what you cannot see.

* map suppliers beyond Tier 1
* understand dependencies (parts → plants → customers)
* quantify ripple effects

### Trend 2 — **Use of external data**

Internal ERP and planning data alone is insufficient.
External signals increasingly matter:

* weather and disaster alerts
* energy policy and regulation
* social/media signals
* macro indicators and logistics constraints

### Trend 3 — **New technology adoption**

Not “technology for technology’s sake,” but technology that enables:

* better forecasting and anomaly detection
* faster scenario generation
* improved decision support

### Trend 4 — **Defining new “axes”**

For example:

* ESG axes (human rights, emissions)
* geopolitical axes (country risk, sanction exposure)
* resilience axes (single-source vs multi-source, inventory buffers)

These axes change how you evaluate suppliers and sourcing strategies.

---

## 5. The two decisive capabilities: content and insight

A key framing slide says future SCM reform is determined by two big factors:

### 1) **Content (data/knowledge) availability**

“Collecting” is not the same as **having usable content**.

Good content has these properties:

* includes information you cannot produce internally (external signals, partner data)
* is continuously updated (freshness matters)
* is structured enough to be connected to decisions (who/what/where/when)

### 2) **Insight (analysis + selection)**

Insights are not “more dashboards.” They require:

* interpretation from a business perspective
* prioritization and trade-off decisions
* process design (who decides what, when, with what evidence)

**A helpful mental model:**
Content is the fuel; insight is the engine. You need both.

---

## 6. How generative AI fits into SCM operations

The lecture proposes that SCM is well-suited to **centralized “Supply Chain Intelligence”** because SCM requires many functions simultaneously:

* search & collect information
* learn from history
* analyze and classify
* forecast
* detect anomalies
* generate reports/content
* propose optimizations and actions

### Why “central management” matters

If each function builds separate AI tools:

* data and definitions diverge
* decisions conflict
* governance and security become inconsistent

Centralized “SC intelligence” aims to provide a shared layer of:

* data ingestion
* semantic normalization
* reusable models
* consistent decision logic

---

## 7. GenAI adoption: challenges and countermeasures

The slides group challenges into four areas and propose practical responses:

### (1) Talent: training, education, and deployment

**Challenge:** AI changes workflows; procurement teams need new skills.

* prompt literacy is not enough
* domain knowledge must be encoded into workflows and evaluation

**Countermeasures:**

* build a training environment (sandbox) for experimentation
* define roles (business owner, data owner, model owner)
* expand gradually from pilot users to broader rollout

### (2) Security and privacy

**Challenge:** procurement data includes contracts, pricing, supplier info.
**Countermeasures:**

* clear data classification rules
* access controls and audit trails
* careful handling of external data sources and model outputs

### (3) Data and system management

**Challenge:** supplier data is fragmented; multi-tier integration is hard.
**Countermeasures:**

* strong data governance and master data principles
* cloud architectures designed for AI integration
* stepwise integration (start from minimal datasets; expand)

### (4) Investment planning (ROI realism)

**Challenge:** unrealistic expectations create disappointment.
**Countermeasures:**

* pilot first with measurable KPIs
* scale only after proving value
* treat AI as a program, not a one-off “tool purchase”

---

## 8. Procurement & purchasing use cases

### Use case 1 — Price assessment (quote evaluation)

The slide shows a practical automation pattern:

* **Inputs:** supplier quotations (often PDFs), historical pricing, cost factors
* **Workflow:** OCR + AI extraction → RPA to move data into systems → AI model for estimation / anomaly checks
* **Outputs:** faster, more consistent price assessments; reduced manual work; better traceability

**Where the value comes from**

* removing “person-dependent” judgment where possible
* standardizing evaluation logic
* surfacing exceptions for humans (AI triage)

### Advanced use case — Supplier performance & risk evaluation

This use case combines:

* **GenAI** to generate scenarios / hypotheses
* **Analytics** to score, rank, and validate

Possible applications:

* predict supplier performance issues using KPI patterns
* incorporate external risk scenarios (disaster, geopolitics)
* prioritize actions (which supplier/part is most urgent)
* monitor in near-real time and trigger alerts

### PwC “Lessons learned”

Procurement decisions often become:

* individualized (“only certain experts know”)
* black-boxed (hard to explain why a decision was made)

So, procurement is a strong candidate for AI that:

* monitors change drivers continuously
* produces decision rationale (“why this is risky”)
* proposes optimizations and responses

---

## 9. Survey insights: why many AI initiatives stall

One slide summarizes a survey finding:

* Few organizations have reached **value creation** with AI in procurement.
* Many implement tools **before** fixing processes and governance.
* Misaligned expectations (e.g., confusing RPA automation with AI decision support) create a “reality gap.”

### Common success factors (implied by the slide)

* governance and ownership clarity
* a promotion structure (who drives adoption, who maintains it)
* a development/operations capability (not only consultants)
* clear and realistic use-case definitions

---

## 10. Guest segment: Resilire’s supply-chain resilience approach

A guest segment (Resilire) focuses on **supply-chain risk diversification** and resilience.

### How the risk landscape is described

As supply chains globalize and become more complex, risks expand from:

* external shocks (disasters, logistics disruptions)
  to include:
* internal / stakeholder-driven risks (ESG, compliance, human rights)

Two major environment shifts are highlighted:

1. **Sustainability management** is expected by governments and stakeholders
2. **Emerging risks** require rapid detection and structured response

### Platform approach (service overview)

The platform concept is:

* centralize supply chain information (including multi-tier)
* connect seamlessly with trading partners
* detect risk proactively and propose responses

A “data hub → supply chain database → AI dashboard” architecture is presented, with applications such as:

* supply-chain risk management (SCRM)
* supplier assessment / questionnaires (SAQ-style workflows)

---

## 11. Avoiding “preparation hell”: a practical rollout method

The guest segment addresses a common blocker:

> “Before working on AI, the preparation feels endless.”

Typical worries:

* “We must enumerate every task/problem first.”
* “We can’t start until ROI is proven.”
* “We don’t know what output AI will produce.”

### Two core premises

1. **Data is important, but perfection is not required to begin.**
   Improve data step-by-step as you learn.
2. **Don’t try to solve everything at once.**
   Start from a simple use case and scale.

### A 4-step AI introduction method

1. **Pick a pain point** (manual, time-consuming, info-heavy work)
2. **Reduce to a minimal use case** (one slice of the process)
3. **Try with existing data “as-is”** (Excel/PDF/ERP—even if messy)
4. **If value appears, then formalize and expand**
   Improve governance, staffing, and data quality after validation.

---

## 12. A layered model for AI-driven transformation

A useful framework in the slides is a **four-layer model**:

1. **Reality layer**
   Collect and unify supply chain data so the digital view reflects reality.
2. **Semantic layer**
   Add meaning and context so AI can “understand” entities and relationships.
3. **Inference layer**
   Enable reasoning: connect signals to interpretations and predictions.
4. **Decision layer**
   Make decision logic explicit so AI can support or automate parts of decisions.

This model prevents “random AI tools” by ensuring each step builds toward decision-making impact.

---

## 13. Practical implementation techniques

### (A) Use AI only where it’s necessary

A slide explicitly argues that using AI for everything is unrealistic.

Use a mix of:

* **exact matching** (traditional algorithms)
* **fuzzy search** (string distance, N-grams)
* **vector/semantic search** (meaning similarity)
* **GenAI** (scenario creation, summarization, reasoning, proposal generation)

This reduces cost and improves speed.

### (B) Build a semantic layer + knowledge graph

Another slide visualizes how to convert fragmented data into AI-ready structure:

* raw inputs: spreadsheets, ERP, contracts/emails, IoT, news
* AI processing: ingestion, cleaning, entity extraction, linking
* output: a contextualized “knowledge graph” connecting:

  * suppliers
  * components/materials
  * sites/locations
  * events/risks
  * business impact

This supports consistent analytics and decision support.

### (C) Continuous data updates require incentives and partner involvement

Procurement data (especially multi-tier) stays stale unless:

* partners have a simple update mechanism
* there’s an incentive to keep information current
* data collection and cleansing are part of daily work, not a one-time project

### (D) Tagging internal and external data to connect risk scenarios

Slides show tagging supply chain entities and linking them to external risk events.
Then AI can:

* propose relevant scenarios (e.g., export restrictions, disasters)
* estimate impact (affected parts, revenue risk, inventory days)
* prioritize responses

### (E) Turn intelligence into action (not just insights)

A final “AI → actionable insight” slide emphasizes:

* automated impact analysis
* prioritization
* action proposals
* report generation for stakeholders

---

## 14. Summary

The combined message of the lecture can be captured in three statements:

1. **Start from clear, small use cases** (not from perfect grand designs).
2. **Create a mechanism for continuous data collection and cleansing**, including trading partners.
3. **Connect AI outputs to decision-making**, using semantic structure + inference + explicit decision logic.

If you do these well, AI improves procurement’s strategic role:

* better resilience to disruption
* faster and more explainable decisions
* improved competitiveness across cost/service/risk/ESG trade-offs
