# Document 1: "2026 AI Winning Strategy"
**Speaker:** Miku Hirano (CEO, Cinnamon AI)

This presentation outlines the strategic shift required for businesses in 2026, moving from simple AI adoption to full integration of "Agents" and "Physical AI."

### 1. Introduction & Company Overview
*   **Speaker Profile:** Miku Hirano is a serial entrepreneur and member of various Japanese government councils (Cabinet Office, METI) regarding AI and economic strategy.
*   **Cinnamon AI Vision:** To create a "Knowledge Platform" that supports human will and decision-making.
*   **Key Product (Super RAG):** A Retrieval-Augmented Generation platform that boasts 3x the accuracy of competitors without customization. It focuses on handling non-structured documents (charts, graphs), citing sources, and preventing hallucinations (AI lies).

### 2. Technological Evolution (2025 vs. 2026)
*   **LLMs:**
    *   *2025:* Became smarter than almost all humans; multimodal capabilities matured.
    *   *2026:* Being directly embedded into business processes.
*   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):**
    *   *2025:* Used primarily to stop hallucinations in internal Q&A.
    *   *2026:* Becomes "Self-growing" and integrates with Agent flows.
*   **AI Agents:**
    *   *2025:* Workflow-based, limited autonomy.
    *   *2026:* Specialized for specific practical tasks; becoming the core of "AI First" strategies.

### 3. Human vs. AI: The Value of "Will"
*   **The 3 Elements of Humanity:** While AI takes over execution, humans retain:
    1.  **Emotion**
    2.  **Will (Intent/Volition)**
    3.  **Body** (Physicality)
*   **Multi-Agent Essence:** The value of multi-agent systems lies in splitting complex jobs, creating self-check structures, and handling long-duration tasks. This allows for the creation of an "AI Organization."

### 4. The 4 Quadrants of Agent Utilization
Hirano categorizes AI Agents based on Input/Output (Natural Language vs. Non-Natural Language):
*   **Execution Entry (Input: Natural / Output: Non-Natural):** e.g., Booking tickets via chat.
*   **Dialogue (Input: Natural / Output: Natural):** e.g., Chatbots.
*   **True Business AI (Input: Non-Natural / Output: Non-Natural):** e.g., Automated invoice payment execution. **(This is the strategic target).**
*   **Contact/Notification (Input: Non-Natural / Output: Natural):** e.g., Confirmation emails.

**The "Winning Strategy":**
1.  Enter via Human UI (Dialogue).
2.  Take over "Execution Authority" (move left to Execution Entry).
3.  Lock in via Automation (move down to True Business AI).
4.  Maximize economic rationality (Control) and ensure transparency (Trust).

### 5. Human-AI Co-existence & Judgment Design
Roles are defined in layers:
*   **Will Layer (Human):** Purpose, Value, Meaning.
*   **Judgment Layer (Human + AI):** Design, Trade-off adjustments.
*   **Execution Layer (AI):** Tasks, Repetitive processing.

**3 Types of Judgment Design:**
1.  **Rules:** Can be codified. **Delegate to AI.**
2.  **Trade-offs:** Values conflict, no single right answer. **AI suggests options; Human decides.**
3.  **Exceptions:** Unprecedented or high social impact. **Human responsibility.**

### 6. G vs. R (Generate vs. Retrieval)
*   **The Trade-off:** AI tools exist on a spectrum between **G** (Creativity/Naturalness - e.g., NotebookLM, Video creation) and **R** (Accuracy/Facts - e.g., Super RAG).
*   **Trend:** In 2025, growth was in "G" products.
*   **Prediction:** The market will shift toward "R" products (reliability), eventually merging into products that are Strong R + Strong G.
*   **R-Type Winning Areas:** Areas with liability, audits, and regulations (Legal, Medical, Finance, HR).

### 7. National AI Strategies
*   **USA:** "Hegemony Maintenance." Focus on competition, deregulation, and innovation speed.
*   **China:** "Global Standardization." State control + industrial application. Exports technology standards.
*   **Japan:** "National Power Maintenance." Focus on reducing external dependency and balancing safety with promotion.
*   **EU:** "Rule Formation." Focus on regulation (AI Act) to prevent dominance by others.

### 8. New Frontiers: Science & Physical AI
*   **AI for Science:** Moving from "hypothesis generation" to "automated experimentation." Japan has an advantage here due to strong equipment/material sectors.
*   **Physical AI:** 2026 will focus on **Indoor/Semi-structured environments** (Warehouses, Factories).
    *   *KPIs:* Productivity, Safety, Labor shortage resolution.
*   **Message to Executives:** Enjoy the speed of evolution, do not cling to the past, and clarify your "Will" (Intent).

# Document 2: "AI Trends and AI Management"
**Source:** Matsuo-Iwasawa Lab, University of Tokyo (Prof. Yutaka Matsuo)
**Date:** 2026/01/21

This document is an academic and technical overview of the state of AI as of early 2026.

### 1. Current State of AI (The "Now" in 2026)
*   **GPT-5 Release (Aug 8, 2025):** OpenAI released GPT-5.
    *   Sam Altman called it "PhD level in all fields."
    *   **Improvements:** 80% reduction in hallucinations, high medical accuracy, improved reasoning (AIME 2025, GPQA).
    *   **Dynamic Model Selection:** Automatically switches between "fast" and "deep thinking" models.
*   **Coding Ability:**
    *   AI (Gemini Deep Think, OpenAI) achieved Gold Medal levels in Math Olympiads and Coding Contests.
    *   **Employment Impact:** Junior engineers in the US are struggling to find work. 30% of new code at Google is written by AI.
    *   *Observation:* AI strengthens Seniors (who can direct it) but displaces Juniors (who used to do the grunt work).
*   **Sora2 (Video AI):**
    *   Released Oct 2025. Caused controversy by generating copyrighted anime characters without permission.
    *   **Response:** Japanese government and publishers (Kodansha, KADOKAWA) demanded "Opt-in" (permission required) systems rather than "Opt-out."
    *   **Business Model:** Licensing deals are emerging (OpenAI x Disney, Suno x Warner Music) to pay rights holders.
*   **DeepSeek-R1 (China, Jan 2026):**
    *   A "Reasoning Model" (thinks before answering) that matches OpenAI's o1 model.
    *   **Open Source:** Released as open source, causing "DeepSeek Shock."
    *   **Performance:** Scored higher than OpenAI o1 on Tokyo University entrance exam metrics (Math).
*   **Open vs. Closed Models:**
    *   Open models (China leading) lag behind Closed models (US leading) by only **3 months**.
    *   China's open strategy is gaining market share over the US.

### 2. Future Outlook
*   **Inference Scaling:** Deep thinking *during* inference (not just training) is the new frontier for accuracy.
*   **AI Agents:**
    *   Applications: Coding (Devin), Sales (Agentforce), Customer Support (Zendesk), HR, Research (SakanaAI).
*   **AI Robots:**
    *   Startups like Figure, UBTech, and 1X are raising massive capital ($100M+).
    *   Focus on humanoid robots for households and industry.

### 3. AI Management
*   **Philosophy:** AI is not a boom; it is the unraveling of human intelligence. Understanding AI limits = understanding human brain limits.
*   **Seeds vs. Needs:** Success comes from connecting Tech Seeds (what AI can do) with Social Needs (what companies/people struggle with).
*   **Economic Impact:**
    *   Generative AI to add $2.6-4.4 trillion to global GDP by 2030.
    *   Labor market: 50% of workers need reskilling by 2025.
    *   Decision making: 15% of corporate decisions made by Agents by 2028.

### Synthesis of the Three Documents
Together, these documents present a cohesive narrative for **2026**:
1.  **Technology is Mature:** LLMs are "PhD level" (GPT-5). The focus has shifted from "Chatting" to "Agents" that do work and "Physical AI" (Robots) that moves things.
2.  **Business Integration is Key:** It is no longer about "using AI"; it is about embedding AI into the core of business strategy (AI Management).
3.  **Geopolitics Matter:** There is a clear "US vs. China" dynamic in AI models and Robotics. Japan is trying to navigate this by leveraging its hardware strengths while adopting Western software/agent architectures and maintaining economic security.
4.  **The "Will":** In a world where AI can think and do, the remaining unique human value is "Will" (Intent/Purpose)—deciding *what* to do.
